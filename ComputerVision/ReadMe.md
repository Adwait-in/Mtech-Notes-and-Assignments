# Computer Vision

## Dependencies and Installation

### Install OpenCV

`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install pandas`
`pip install matplotlib`

`numpy` will be automatically installed with opencv so no need to intall it separately.

## Running Example Files

Dependent images are stored in the images folder.

When the complete repository is downloaded to run the examples first `cd ComputerVision` as all the links used are relative to ComputerVision folder and will throw error other wise.

`python opencv_basics_1.py`

> To run `.ipynd` files copy them to Google Colab as they might needed dependencies that are not mentioned in the above sections.
